        <strong>1.7 Service Levels and Credits.</strong>&nbsp;<br><br>

        <strong>(a) Availability Requirement.</strong>&nbsp; Form.io shall make the Services available, as measured over the course of each calendar month during the Term and any additional periods during which Form.io does or is required to perform any Services (each such calendar month, a “Service Period”), at least 99.95% of the time, excluding only the time the Services are not available solely as a result of one or more Exceptions (the “Availability Requirement”). “Available” means the Services are available and operable for access and use by Customer and its End Users over the internet in material conformity with the Specifications. “Availability” has a correlative meaning. The Services are not considered Available in the event of a material performance degradation or inoperability of the Services, in whole or in part. <br><br>

        <strong>(b) Exceptions.</strong>&nbsp;No period of Service degradation or inoperability will be included in calculating Availability to the extent that such downtime or degradation is due to any of the following (”Exceptions”): (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; Customer’s or any of its End Users’ misuse of the Services; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; failures of Customer’s or its End Users’ internet connectivity; (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp; internet or other network traffic problems other than problems arising in or from networks actually or required to be provided or controlled by Form.io; (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp; Customer’s or any of its End Users’ failure to meet any minimum hardware or software requirements; or (v)&nbsp;&nbsp; Scheduled Downtime as set forth in Paragraph 1.7(c).<br><br>

        <strong>(c) Scheduled Downtime.</strong>&nbsp; Throughout the Term, Form.io shall use its best efforts to provide live updates to avoid any downtime. In the event that Services require downtime, Form.io shall notify Customer at least 24 hours in advance of all scheduled outages of the Services in whole or in part (“Scheduled Downtime”). All such scheduled outages shall: (a) last no longer than one hour; (b) be scheduled between the hours of 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., Central Time; and (c) occur no more frequently than once per month; provided that Form.io may notify Customer of extensions of Scheduled Downtime above one hour. <br><br>

        <strong>(d) Customer Reporting.</strong>&nbsp; Customer shall report any unscheduled system downtime lasting more than three (3) hours and any material error, bug, or defect in the Services to Form.io’s support email listed above immediately upon becoming aware or receiving notice of such material system downtime, error, bug, or defect. <br><br>

        <strong>(e) Remedies for Service Availability Failures.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; If the actual Availability of the Services is less than the Availability requirement for any Service Period, such failure shall constitute a service error for which Form.io shall issue to Customer the corresponding Service Availability Credits as set forth in below (”Service Availability Credits”) and in accordance with Paragraph 1.7(f). </p>

        </tr>
    </table>

    <br>
    <p>
        <strong>(f) Availability and Service Availability Credits.</strong>&nbsp; The parties acknowledge and agree that each of the Service Availability Credits assessed pursuant to Section 1.7: (a) is a reasonable estimate of the diminished value of the Services that may arise from the corresponding service error, which would be impossible or very difficult to accurately estimate as of the Effective Date; (b) is not intended as, and should not be deemed to be, a penalty or forfeiture; and (c) may be credited or set off against any Total Monthly Subscription Fees or other charges payable to Form.io under this Agreement.
        <br><br>
        <strong>1.8 Changes</strong>&nbsp; Form.io reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make any changes to the Services that it deems necessary or useful to: (a) maintain or enhance (i) the quality or delivery of the Services to its customers; (ii) the competitive strength of, or market for the Services; or (iii) the Services’ cost efficiency or performance; or (b) to comply with applicable law, provided that the above changes shall not impact the material functions of the Services. In any case, Form.io warrants the backward compatibilities between the versions of the Software. Form.io shall provide Customer with thirty (30) days’ advanced notice prior to any material changes to the Services. &nbsp; <br><br>
